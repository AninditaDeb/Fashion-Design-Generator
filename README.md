# Fashion-AttGAN: Attribute-Aware Fashion Editing with VAE+CGAN 
This repo provides the dataset used in our paper "Fashion-AttGAN: Attribute-Aware Fashion Editing with Multi-Objective GAN" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07460). 

## Dataset
The dataset contains 14,221 images and corresponding predicted attribute values. Currently we publish two attribute categories among others: clothing colors and sleeve lengths (data/data.json). 22 attribute values in total are selected in this published dataset. Therefore each image is associated with 1 color value and 1 sleeve-length value (these two values can be empty since there are other values of these two categories that are not covered in this dataset).

The image data is adapted from the VITON dataset, and can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DBJY3wPyEDvcSvQjZkX8Kjg6nuRDRIa7/view?usp=sharing)
